# Timelines

This tool allows to generate timelines in JavaScript using the p5.js and
Moment.js libraries.

You can find a playground of it on http://gothor.github.io/timelines.

## Getting started

## Installation

Clone this project wherever you need it using the following command in your
terminal.

```
git clone https://github.com/Gothor/timelines.git
```

### Prerequisites

In order to make this tool work, you need to import the next two libraries.

#### p5.js

Go on the p5.js website : [Download p5.js](https://p5js.org/download/).

And then download the **p5.min.js** file in the same folder as Timeline.js.

*You may instead download the **p5.js** file which is the uncompressed version
of **p5.min.js**.*

Then import the p5.js library before Timeline.js.

```
<script src="p5.min.js"></script>
<script src="Timeline.js"></script>
```

You can also import it through a CDN.

```
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/p5.js/0.6.0/p5.min.js"></script>
```

#### Moment.js

Go on the Moment.js website : [Download Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/).

And then download the **moment.min.js** file in the same folder as Timeline.js.

*You may instead download the **moment.js** file which is the uncompressed
version of **moment.min.js**.*

Then import the Moment.js library before Timeline.js.

```
<script src="moment.min.js"></script>
<script src="Timeline.js"></script>
```

You can also import it through a CDN.
    
```
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/moment.js/2.21.0/moment.min.js"></script>
```

## Acknowledgements

This tool is totally inspired by Google Charts timelines. It allows to generate
timeline as static pictures looking like timelines from Google Charts.
